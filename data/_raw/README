The files in this directory contain the raw data used for the project. They were extracted form three different databases: Protein Data Bank (PDB), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Structural Classification Of Proteins (SCOP).

All files were downloaded on 03/05/2022.

- entries.idx
List of all PDB ID codes, header accession date, compound, source, author list, resolution and experiment type (if not X-ray).

- pdb_entry_type.txt
List of all PDB entries, identification of each as a protein, nucleic acid, or protein-nucleic acid complex and whether the structure was determined by diffraction or NMR.

- pdb.accession2taxid.txt
TaxID mapping for live protein sequence records which have PDB identifiers.

- rankedlineage.tsv.gz
Select ancestor names for well-established taxonomic ranks (species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, superkingdom).

How to get the file:
  1. Download the compressed new_taxdump directory
  2. Extract the file rankedlineage.dmp from the directory
  3. Write the file in a compressed format. The following was used in this project:
  
    taxa_raw <- read_delim(file = "data/_raw/rankedlineage.dmp",
                           delim = "\t|\t")
    write_delim(taxa_raw,
                file = "data/_raw/rankedlineage.tsv.gz",
                delim = "|")
