```

## Intoduction

- what we want to do?
- why do we want to do it?
- show the problem (some example plots)

![example of pie chart on the rcsb](example_pdb_piechart.png){width=75%}

## Data

- show which data we needed based on plots we wanted to do

(for example the scop data, and what did we need from there)

## Our bar plots

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot
- Just show the plots, important parts of code and biological/scientific insight
```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
