## Introduction

-Bioinformatic tools such as AlphaFold has PDB as a source for training the prediction of 3D structures of proteins

-Models with better predictions could be the result of bias from the types of proteins that have been studied extensively

-The problem: The data present in the https://www.rcsb.org/stats did not provide the insights we needed for this
